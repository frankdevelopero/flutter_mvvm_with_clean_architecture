# flutter_clean

This is a sample Flutter project that demonstrates the use of GetX, MVVM, and Clean Architecture.

## Architecture

This project follows the Clean Architecture pattern, which separates the application into layers with specific responsibilities:

- Presentation or UI Layer: Contains the UI code and is responsible for presenting the data to the user.
- Domain Layer: Contains the business logic and rules of the application.
- Data Layer: Contains the implementation of data providers, such as API clients or database access.

## What would I have liked to do?

Things I would have liked to do and couldn't due to time constraints

- Unit Test, Widget Test.
- Group common things in Core to reuse them in features.
